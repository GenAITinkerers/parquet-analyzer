| `docker-compose down` | Stops and removes all containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`. |
| `docker-compose build` | Builds or rebuilds services defined in the Compose file. |
| `docker-compose start` | Starts existing containers for a service. |
| `docker-compose stop` | Stops running containers without removing them. |
| `docker-compose restart` | Restarts running containers. |
| `docker-compose ps` | Lists all containers managed by the current Compose file. |
| `docker-compose logs` | Shows logs for all services. |
| `docker-compose logs -f` | Follows log output (like `tail -f`). |

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Commands

| Command | Description |
